# webD-The-simon-game
I added two JavaScript files: one in game file and another as an extra file which includes my first approach for this game (using loops and async-await concepts). I will try to complete this game using the second method too, which is currently incomplete as  I'm encountering some trouble while adding input (button click) , so for now, I've added prompts as input.
