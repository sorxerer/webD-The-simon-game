# webD-The-simon-game
I added two JavaScript files: one in game file and another as an extra file which includes my first approach for this game (using loops and async-await concepts). I will try to complete this game using the second method, which is currently incomplete. I'm encountering some trouble while adding input, so for now, I've added prompts as input.
